Annual pre-tax profits fell by almost two-thirds to £66.   8m as sales of food, clothing and homeware all declined. On Tuesday the retailer said it plans to close 100 shops by 2022, accelerating an overhaul that it says is "vital" for its future.
The expense of closing stores and revamping the business cost M&S £321m in the 12 months to March.
M&S has already shut 21 stores and revealed the location of 14 further closures on Tuesday.

   Oxford University has apologised to David Lammy after retweeting a post labelling his criticism "bitter".
   The original tweet, sent by a student, was in response to the Labour MP saying Oxford was "a bastion of white, middle class, southern privilege".
   Mr Lammy asked if the tweet represented the university's official position - at which point a senior staff member apologised and took responsibility.
   Just 11% of last year's undergraduates were from disadvantaged backgrounds.
   Oxford's director of public affairs, Ceri Thomas, said Mr Lammy's comments showed "no sign of bitterness" and there was "work to do" to improve diversity among students.

   A woman who threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, which led to him ending his life, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years.
   Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015.
   At Bristol Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Wallace it was "an act of pure evil".
   She was cleared of murdering her former partner but found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent.

   Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need to meet the challenges they face.
   The home secretary, whose brother is a chief superintendent in West Midlands, pledged in his first speech to the Police Federation to provide the "tools and powers" frontline officers need.
   "I've seen the impact the job has had on family life", he said.
   His predecessors have often been criticised by the federation for cutting police budgets.
   Mr Javid promised to prioritise police funding during the next Home Office spending review.

   The US state department has urged its staff in China to alert them to any abnormal hearing or vision issues after one employee reported mystery symptoms.
   The person experienced "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure", a statement said.
   The US previously said its diplomats in Cuba had suffered similar symptoms after suspected sonic attacks.
   China-US relations have been strained recently, with the threat of a trade war looming.
   The US has not accused China of being behind the issues.
   Embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee said the employee suffered a "variety of physical symptoms" between late 2017 and April 2018 while working at the US consulate in the city of Guangzhou. The employee was sent back to the US, and on 18 May the embassy learnt that they had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), Ms Lee added.

   An investigation by BBC Wales Investigates has exposed a secretive network of illegal hunters in south Wales.
   The programme team went undercover with two badger-baiting gangs as part of a six-month investigation.
   Wearing a hidden camera "John", a former special operations soldier, infiltrated one group to reveal the criminal activity of badger digging and lamping, where wild animals are torn apart and the hunters' own dogs are often abused.
   "I've had some experiences in the military that I thought would prepare me for dealing with this and I knew there was going to be some violence towards these animals but what I saw was shocking.
   To these people, killing animals is a sport - the more brutal, the better.
   The BBC team was able infiltrate the gangs using social media." - John

I'm hiding behind the sofa in the living room, sweating profusely and fumbling with my phone.
"Where are you, you little thief?" my dad yells as he comes down the stairs.
"I'm going to kill you, you hear me?"
He comes into the room and I can see he's holding a carving knife.
But suddenly someone knocks at the front door and he goes to answer it. It's the next-door neighbour.
"Hi there! You all right?" she asks nervously.....

Facebook is asking British users to send naked photos of themselves to the social network, to try to stop revenge porn.
If you're worried an intimate photo of you could be shared by someone else, the idea is to get it blocked before it appears online.
Similar technology is used to try to stop the spread of child abuse images.
Facebook's been testing the system in Australia and is extending the trial to the UK, the USA and Canada.
A spokesman told Newsbeat the idea is open to people in the UK now.
