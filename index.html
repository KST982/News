   Oxford University has apologised to David Lammy after retweeting a post labelling his criticism "bitter".
   The original tweet, sent by a student, was in response to the Labour MP saying Oxford was "a bastion of white, middle class, southern privilege".
   Mr Lammy asked if the tweet represented the university's official position - at which point a senior staff member apologised and took responsibility.
   Just 11% of last year's undergraduates were from disadvantaged backgrounds.
   Oxford's director of public affairs, Ceri Thomas, said Mr Lammy's comments showed "no sign of bitterness" and there was "work to do" to improve diversity among students.

   Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need to meet the challenges they face.
   The home secretary, whose brother is a chief superintendent in West Midlands, pledged in his first speech to the Police Federation to provide the "tools and powers" frontline officers need.
   "I've seen the impact the job has had on family life", he said.
   His predecessors have often been criticised by the federation for cutting police budgets.
   Mr Javid promised to prioritise police funding during the next Home Office spending review.

   The US state department has urged its staff in China to alert them to any abnormal hearing or vision issues after one employee reported mystery symptoms.
   The person experienced "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure", a statement said.
   The US previously said its diplomats in Cuba had suffered similar symptoms after suspected sonic attacks.
   China-US relations have been strained recently, with the threat of a trade war looming.
   The US has not accused China of being behind the issues.
   Embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee said the employee suffered a "variety of physical symptoms" between late 2017 and April 2018 while working at the US consulate in the city of Guangzhou. The employee was sent back to the US, and on 18 May the embassy learnt that they had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), Ms Lee added.

   Wearing a hidden camera "John", a former special operations soldier, infiltrated one group to reveal the criminal activity of badger digging and lamping, where wild animals are torn apart and the hunters' own dogs are often abused.
   "I've had some experiences in the military that I thought would prepare me for dealing with this and I knew there was going to be some violence towards these animals but what I saw was shocking.
   To these people, killing animals is a sport - the more brutal, the better.
   The BBC team was able infiltrate the gangs using social media." - John
