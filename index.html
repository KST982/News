Annual pre-tax profits fell by almost two-thirds to £66.   8m as sales of food, clothing and homeware all declined. On Tuesday the retailer said it plans to close 100 shops by 2022, accelerating an overhaul that it says is "vital" for its future.
The expense of closing stores and revamping the business cost M&S £321m in the 12 months to March.
M&S has already shut 21 stores and revealed the location of 14 further closures on Tuesday.

 </p>
   Oxford University has apologised to David Lammy after retweeting a post labelling his criticism "bitter".
   The original tweet, sent by a student, was in response to the Labour MP saying Oxford was "a bastion of white, middle class, southern privilege".
   Mr Lammy asked if the tweet represented the university's official position - at which point a senior staff member apologised and took responsibility.
   Just 11% of last year's undergraduates were from disadvantaged backgrounds.
   Oxford's director of public affairs, Ceri Thomas, said Mr Lammy's comments showed "no sign of bitterness" and there was "work to do" to improve diversity among students.

   A woman who threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, which led to him ending his life, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years.
   Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015.
   At Bristol Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Wallace it was "an act of pure evil".
   She was cleared of murdering her former partner but found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent.

   Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need to meet the challenges they face.
   The home secretary, whose brother is a chief superintendent in West Midlands, pledged in his first speech to the Police Federation to provide the "tools and powers" frontline officers need.
   "I've seen the impact the job has had on family life", he said.
   His predecessors have often been criticised by the federation for cutting police budgets.
   Mr Javid promised to prioritise police funding during the next Home Office spending review.

   The US state department has urged its staff in China to alert them to any abnormal hearing or vision issues after one employee reported mystery symptoms.
   The person experienced "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure", a statement said.
   The US previously said its diplomats in Cuba had suffered similar symptoms after suspected sonic attacks.
   China-US relations have been strained recently, with the threat of a trade war looming.
   The US has not accused China of being behind the issues.
   Embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee said the employee suffered a "variety of physical symptoms" between late 2017 and April 2018 while working at the US consulate in the city of Guangzhou. The employee was sent back to the US, and on 18 May the embassy learnt that they had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), Ms Lee added.

Facebook is asking British users to send naked photos of themselves to the social network, to try to stop revenge porn.
If you're worried an intimate photo of you could be shared by someone else, the idea is to get it blocked before it appears online.
Similar technology is used to try to stop the spread of child abuse images.
Facebook's been testing the system in Australia and is extending the trial to the UK, the USA and Canada.
A spokesman told Newsbeat the idea is open to people in the UK now.

The property magnate-turned politician owns two golf courses in Scotland, and one in Ireland. He was due to arrive in the UK after attending a NATO summit on 11-12 July, and the main focus of the trip will be talks with Theresa May on 13 July. It will not be a state visit but Mr Trump is expected to meet the Queen. Downing Street previously referred to Mr Trump's July trip as a "working visit", after he previously cancelled a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. A formal programme for the visit has not been agreed by either country, though it has been speculated that Mr Trump may choose to meet the prime minister at her country residence, Chequers in Buckinghamshire.

    The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Health Foundation said the NHS would need an extra 4% a year - or Â£2,000 per UK household - for the next 15 years.

  The chances of an interest rate rise this year have receded after Consumer Price Inflation fell to 2.4% in April - its lowest level since March 2017.
<p>
  The fall from 2.5% in March was partly due to the timing of Easter, which meant a seasonal rise in air fares was not included in April this year. The pound fell about half a cent against the dollar after the figures were released before rising to $1.3368.

England is facing water supply shortages by 2050 unless rapid action is taken to curb water use and wastage, the Environment Agency has warned.
<p>
  Its new report says enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people is lost through leakage every day. Population growth and the impact of climate change are expected to add to supply pressures. The agency wants people to have a personal water target and has urged them to use water more wisely at home.
