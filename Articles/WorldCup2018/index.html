<p class="paragraph2"> Striker Kane, 24, was informed about being made skipper by manager Gareth Southgate a few weeks ago and it was officially confirmed on Tuesday.

Kane scored 41 goals in all competitions last season as Tottenham finished third in the Premier League.</p>

<p class="paragraph3">"It's impossible not to dream about lifting the World Cup. It's the biggest competition in the world," said Kane.

"I believe we can win it - anyone can. I cannot sit here and say we are not going to win it because we could do.

"It is my mindset and I want to win at everything I do. The players in the team want to as well. It is worth fighting for. I am sure we have all had dreams of lifting it and it is an opportunity for us.

"We are not favourites but you look at this season, no-one would have thought Liverpool getting to the Champions League final. You look at Manchester United back in the Sir Alex Ferguson days, they had a young team and dominated the Premier League for years to come.

"Being young is not an excuse - it could be a good thing. I believe we can and that is what we want to try and do. Anything else is not good enough."

England head to Russia on 12 June and face Tunisia in their opening game on 18 June, followed by matches against Panama and Belgium.</p>

<p class="paragraph4">Kane first captained England in last summer's 2-2 World Cup qualifier in Scotland, where he scored a late equaliser, before going on to wear the armband on a further three occasions.

Spurs team-mate Eric Dier and Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson have also skippered England recently.

Kane, who has scored 12 goals in 23 appearances for his country, was described as a "meticulous professional" by Southgate.

"It is a massive day and a very proud day," he said. "It is a dream come true. I found out a few weeks ago when I met Gareth Southgate. We were talking for an hour and he said he wanted me to be the captain.

"I have had to keep it quiet for a while now but it is fantastic. I filled up with pride and went home and told my family.

"Not much changes, I am someone who wants to lead by example on and off the pitch. That is what I will try to do.

"There are some young players in the squad who look up to players like that. There are some older players who I can learn from too."
</p>

    <p class="paragraph5">Southgate, who told the England squad during a meeting at St George's Park on Monday night, added:

"Harry has some outstanding personal qualities. One of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day.

"He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time and that has been his drive.

"My feeling is that over the last 18 months in the camps that he's been with us he has shown that he has got the desire to take that into a team environment and he recognises the importance of bringing others with him."   </p>
